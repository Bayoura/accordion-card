## What I learned

- I built an accordion with JS and CSS. It was rather simple, but it's a handy skill to have.
- I also learned more about the HTML tags `summary` and `details` which you can also use to achieve the accordion-effect (I decided against using those because I wanted to get more into JS)
- The most difficult thing about this project was the positioning of the images, especially because you had to layer them on top of each other.
